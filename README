This is the Application Binary Interface Generic Analysis and
Instrumentation Library.

It aims at constructing, manipulating, serializing and de-serializing
ABI-relevant artifacts.

The set of artifacts that we are intersted is made of quantities like
types, variable, fonctions and declarations of a given library or
program.  For a given library or program this set of quantities is
called an ABI corpus.

This library aims at (among other things) providing a way to comparing
two ABI Corpuses, provide detailed information about their
differences, and help build tools to infer interesting conclusions
about these differences.
