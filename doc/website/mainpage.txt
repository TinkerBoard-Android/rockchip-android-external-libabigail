\mainpage Home page of the ABI Generic Analysis and Instrumentation Library

\par Introduction

This project aims at providing a C++ library for constructing,
manipulating, serializing and de-serializing ABI-relevant artifacts.
The set of artifacts that we are interested in is made of
constructions like types, variables, functions and declarations of a
given library or program.  For a given program or library, this set of
constructions is called an ABI corpus.

Thus the project aims at providing a library to manipulate ABI
corpuses, compare them, provide detailed information about their
differences and help build tools to infer interesting conclusions
about these differences.

\par Documentation

The html documentation of the library is available online <a
href="http://sourceware.org/libabigail/apidoc">here</a>.

\par Getting the source code

This project is still in an early stage; we haven't released any
official tarball yet.  You can get the source code in a read-only
manner from our <a
href="http://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libabigail.git">Git
repository</a> by doing:

\code{.sh}
	git clone git://sourceware.org/git/libabigail.git
\endcode

If you have write access on sourceware.org, you can check the source
out in read-write by doing:

\code{.sh}
	git clone ssh://sourceware.org/git/libabigail.git
\endcode

\par Compiling

To compile libabigail, you first need to install its dependencies.  At
the moment the dependencies are the following Free Software packages:

    \li <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">libxml2</a>
    \li <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">autoconf</a>
    \li <a href="http://www.nih.at/libzip">libzip</a>
    \li <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/elfutils/">elfutils</a>

Then go to your local libabigail.git directory where the source code
you've checked out lies and create a 'build' directory that will
receive the binaries resulting from the compilation:

\code{.sh}
    cd libabigail
    mkdir build
\endcode

Generate the relevant build-system-related information needed to
configure the package for compilation, by typing:

\code{.sh}
    autoreconf -i
\endcode

Then configure the package:

\code{.sh}
    cd build
    ../configure --prefix=<absolute-path-of-where-you-want-the-binaries-to-be-installed>
\endcode

Then build the package

\code{.sh}
    make
\endcode

And then install its resulting binaries and documentation:

\code{.sh}
    make install
\endcode

\par Contribute and file bug reports
