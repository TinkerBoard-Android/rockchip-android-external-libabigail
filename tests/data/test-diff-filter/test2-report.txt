2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

  [C]'function void foo(const C0&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 0 of type 'const C0&' has sub-type changes:
      in unqualified underlying type 'C0&':
        in referenced type 'struct C0':
          size changed from 16 to 24 bits
          2 data member changes:
           'E0 C0::m0' offset changed from 0 to 8
           'E1 C0::m1' offset changed from 8 to 16

          1 data member insertion:
            'char C0::m2', at offset 0 (in bits)

          1 member function insertion:
            'method C0::C0()'
  [C]'function void bar(const C1&)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
    parameter 0 of type 'const C1&' has sub-type changes:
      in unqualified underlying type 'C1&':
        in referenced type 'class C1':
          size changed from 8 to 64 bits
          1 data member insertion:
            'int C1::m1', at offset 32 (in bits)


1 Added function:
  'method C0::C0()'
